title: Update
---

All [premium extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) for the Meta Box plugin can be updated automatically or manually. The automatic update uses WordPress update mechanism which checks for new versions twice a day. This is the recommended way to get new updates from our website.

## Auto update

To update extensions automatically, follow the steps below:

1. Download and install the [**Updater**](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-updater/) extension (FREE).
1. If you don't have an account on our website, please register one by clicking the **My Account** link at the top right of this page. Skip to step 3 if you already have one.
1. Go to your profile page by clicking the **My Account** link at the top right of this page.
1. In your profile page, you will see all downloads for your purchased extensions. You will also see the API key. Copy it.
1. Now go to your website, login to the admin area, then navigate to *Settings &rarr; Meta Box Updater* in the main menu on the left.
1. On the settings page of the updater plugin, enter your API key and save. Make sure you paste the correct API you just copied above. (If you see message _Invalid license key_, please try again one more time).

From now on, when WordPress checks new versions for plugins, it will also check for new versions of Meta Box extensions. If there is any new update, you'll see this:

Then you can update the extensions the same way as for other plugins by clicking **update now** link. For more information about the **Update** extension, please see the [extension page](https://metabox.io/docs/meta-box-updater/).

## Manual update

If you can't install the Updater extension, you can always update the extensions manually. Please following these steps:

1. If you don't have an account on our website, please register one by clicking the **Register** link at the top right of this page. Skip to step 2 if you already have one.
1. Go to your profile page by clicking the **My Account** link at the top right of this page.
1. In your profile page, you will see all downloads for your purchased extensions. Download the extension(s) to your computer, unzip the file and upload the extension folder to your website, overwrite old files.

If you have any issue with updating extensions, please open a new thread in the [premium support forum](https://metabox.io/support/).
