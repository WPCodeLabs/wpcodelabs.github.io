This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Meta Box plugin and extensions. We'll cover topics such as installation, creating custom meta boxes and fields, get meta value and give you some tutorials on using the plugins to speed up your development workflow.

All the documentation are listed on the left menu. You can also use the search box to find the documentation quickly.

## So what is Meta Box, exactly?

Meta Box is a simple yet powerful plugin that helps developers build custom meta boxes and custom fields in WordPress fast and easily.

The plugin lets you define custom meta boxes and custom fields via arrays and handles everything behind the scene automatically. It has a wide range of field types, field settings and supports not only post meta but also term meta, user meta, comment meta, settings pages and custom tables.

## Contribution

Like Meta Box plugin, this documentation is [open sourced on Github](https://github.com/wpmetabox/docs). The website is powered by Jekyll and the content is written in Markdown.

On the top of each documentation page, there's a **Improve this page** link, which redirects you to the Github page where you can edit the content. If you find anything incorrect in the documentation or out-dated, please help us fix it.

In case you come across anything along the way that we haven't covered, or if you know of a tip you think others would find handy, please [file an issue](https://github.com/wpmetabox/docs/issues/new) and we'll see about including it in this guide.
